This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It surfaces an API to be used as the "Request Url" endpoint for a Slack App, called Buddy Up.

The Buddy Up app's primary purpose is to facilitate 1-1 meetups within a Slack channel. The core scenario is to automatically match users in a Slack channel once a month via a message, something like the message shown below:
